# Python Classes
1. Polymorphism, multiple classes can be interchangeable
2. Inheritance, copies data & behavior from one class to another
3. Encapsulation, conceals data?
Python is a consenting adult language, and doesn't have proper encapsulation.

Classes are Object Factories or Instance Blueprints. They have...
- Methods: like a function in a class
- Attributes: key/value data
